# Description
This Addon lets you replace Soul, Mega and Ivuln spheres with weapons. Intended for generous maps or those people that just don't want them (me).
Only requires [Hideous Destructor](https://codeberg.org/mc776/HideousDestructor), duh.

The CVar is `MagicBallReplacement` and it goes from 0 to 3.
But it also has it's own Menu, so no need to mess with the console.
